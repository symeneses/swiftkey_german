# Project Swiftkey: German Corpora

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive text model. That means, I will use some data science, or to be more specific, NLP (Natural Language Processing) to predict the next words a user intends to type. This reduces the time a person needs to write a message.

- An exploratory analysis can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/symeneses/swiftkey_german).
- Slides with a brief explanation is available [here](http://rpubs.com/symeneses/swiftkey_german_slides).

The final **app** is in this [link](https://symeneses.shinyapps.io/SwiftKey_German/).
